If you want to create your own bot or contribute to my project feel free! I surely can need some help :). (Look for the help wanted tag or you maybe already have a plan of what you want to add.)

To make the bot run you need to create your own oauth.ini file so your bot can log into Reddit. You also need a Steam API key to make Steam API requests.  
I'm using Python 3.5. Some of the libraries I use have to be installed manually (e.g. sqlite3, praw, OAuth2Util, requests).

If you have questions message me on [Reddit] or [Steam].

You can also do suggestions. Please create an issue so I can keep track. Currently I'm trying to solve the [current issues](https://github.com/NNTin/Reply-Dota-2-Reddit/issues).  
Please note I do this as a hobby and I don't have deep programming skills so things will take a while or I won't be able to make it out of my own incompetence. But this is a good learning experience so I think I will eventually get it right. :)

### Summon the bot
\<player link\> [amount:\<amount of games\>] [view:detailed] [heroes:\<hero name\>{+\<hero name\>}]

<>: mandatory
\[]: optional
{}: repeat as often as you want
