If you want to create your own bot or contribute to my project feel free! I surely can need some help :). (Look for the help wanted tag or you maybe already have a plan of what you want to add.)

To make the bot run you need to create your own oauth.ini file so your bot can log into Reddit. You also need a Steam API key to make Steam API requests.  
I'm using Python 3.5. Some of the libraries I use have to be installed manually (e.g. sqlite3, praw, OAuth2Util, requests).

If you have questions message me on [Reddit] or [Steam].

You can also do suggestions. Please create an issue so I can keep track. Currently I'm trying to solve the [current issues](https://github.com/NNTin/Reply-Dota-2-Reddit/issues).  
Please note I do this as a hobby and I don't have deep programming skills so things will take a while or I won't be able to make it out of my own incompetence. But this is a good learning experience so I think I will eventually get it right. :)

### Summon the bot
\<player link\> [amount:\<amount of games\>] [view:detailed]

### TODOs
* Make filtering by hero, game mode work 
* Delete comment when bot caller messages bot: Bots provides delete link in post. Bot caller can message bot with pre-filled message and make bot delete post. 
* Analyze Meta of 1 or more players: Lists average Radiant/Dire stats (whole team, support, carry) as well as hero choices. 
* Make bot respond to private messages: Allow users to stay anonymous. 
* Cross subreddit bot summons by adding /u/\<bot name\> 
* Display Live League games: Displays real time data of an on-going league games. Similar to /u/D2TournamentThreads
